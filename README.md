## Sanity CMS!
To make changes to the Sanity CMS, first run `yarn sanity` to start up the local Sanity instance. Then you can use the console at `localhost:3333` to add content, or you can edit the schemas in `sanity/schemas` folder

When you are ready to deploy, run `yarn sanity:deploy` to deploy the changes to the Sanity instance on the cloud.
